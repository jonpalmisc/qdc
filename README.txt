Quartz Display Configurator - Version 0.2.0
Copyright (c) 2019-2020 Jon Palmisciano

1.  About

    This program is a stripped-down version of my previous project, QuartzDC. It
    does not have as many features as QuartzDC does. At this time I am unsure if
    I will continue to port over features from the original program, as this
    version meets my requirements for daily use.

2.  Installation

    Clone the repository and run the install target included in the Makefile.

3.  Usage

    See the usage message provided by the program for more information.

2.  License
